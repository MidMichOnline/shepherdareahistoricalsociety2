<h2>Mission of the Society</h2>

<p align="left">The Shepherd Area Historical Society was formed in 1978 to preserve and honor the history of the Shepherd area. The Society maintains files, scrapbooks, and historical data on many families local to the Salt River and Shepherd villages. In addition there are many items of historical value plus historical displays within the museums.</p>

<p align="left">The Society maintains two historic buildings in Shepherd, the Shepherd Powerhouse Museum on Maple Street and the Little Red Schoolhouse Museum on Hall Street.</p>

<h2>Meetings and Membership</h2>
