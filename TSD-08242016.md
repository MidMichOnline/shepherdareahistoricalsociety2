[Alumni Game Information](https://www.penflip.com/midmichonline/alumni-game-information?invite=To7pKs7c)	OK, I have the teams for this Sunday. Games are at 10:00 and 1:00. We will have 2 informal practices on Friday and Saturday evenings at 6:00 if you would like to hit and throw a ball around. Between games, we will have a lunch. I will supply drinks, plates, silverware and am grilling pork loins. I am asking that people bring a dish to pass.
