<p class="c0 c6">From the <a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/Shepherd-Police-Department-205632619455314/?fref%3Dnf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1470959524602000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRc5k2nIS5gv_WYDR0EPQk4XWkCg">Shepherd Police Department</a></p>

The Old 27 Motor Tour will be driving through Shepherd, down Wright Avenue, and then north on Chippewa to their next destination on August 25th (2 weeks from today).

They will not be stopping, just driving through. Based on our estimates, they should be here between 5:30 and 5:45. The roads will be blocked off, so we can get the numerous vehicles through Shepherd in an efficient fashion.

So grab your lawn chairs and enjoy the beautiful vehicles!
