<p class="c7"><em>From the <a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/Shepherd-Police-Department-205632619455314/?fref%3Dnf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1470879712208000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFlSwhC9vANCnFjUDj6Lus2YBgXHw">Shepherd Police Department</a></em></p>

Good afternoon! Today, our department, along with every other law enforcement agency in Isabella County, were able to participate in Active Shooter Training at CMU. It is training we hope and pray we never have to use, but if we do I can confidently say that our county is prepared.

Don't forget your Foster Closet donations. Officer Janofski starts Monday...he still has lots of room on his desk to fill up!

Enjoy the rest of your day!
