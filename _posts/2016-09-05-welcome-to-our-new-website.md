We're glad you found our new site! You'll find information here about the Shepherd, Michigan, area, including families, the villages of Shepherd and Salt River, and much more! Our museums are open during the Maple Syrup Festival, which is held annually in the last full weekend of April. If you are interested in visiting at another time, see our <a href="http://www.shepherdareahistoricalsociety.org/?page_id=13">Museums</a> page for contact information.
