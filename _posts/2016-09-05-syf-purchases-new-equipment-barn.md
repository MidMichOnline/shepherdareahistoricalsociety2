Thanks to the generous support of our donors and bowlers at our bowling tournament this past spring, we were able to purchase SYFâ€™s new equipment barn. We are thankful for the relationship that we have with the school that allows us to put it on school grounds. A BIG THANK YOU to Rick, Lucas, &amp; Noah Judge, Nate Ferency, Nate Buckner, and Brent Curtiss for getting the barn in place!
