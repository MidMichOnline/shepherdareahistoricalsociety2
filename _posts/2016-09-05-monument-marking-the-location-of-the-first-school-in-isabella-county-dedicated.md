On Saturday, August 20, 2016, the Isabella Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution dedicated a stone marker which commemorated the first schoolhouse in Isabella County.

During the ceremony, Brian Eldred sang a couple of songs, and DAR Past Regent Candy Henderson gave some background on the School Monument project which culminated in the moving of the stone marker to Little Salt River Park. She thanked several people who contributed to the project including John Williams, who made the original suggestion, and Larry Noyes, President of the Shepherd Area Historical Society, whose research determined the school house's former location.
